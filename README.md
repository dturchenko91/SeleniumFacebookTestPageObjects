# SeleniumFacebookTestPageObjects
A better, cleaner version of the selenium facebook test that incorporates the page objects manual

this test not only includes better methodology for running selenium functions on facebook page elements, but also includes checks, such as checks to see if the user is logged into to facebook already, or to see if the status visibility is already changed

also password and email are now entered as console inputs
